# LongProject

Step 1:
Getting locations of the TEs from EDTA  (have TEs in Athaliana)

Step 2:
Creating a fasta file of the TE sequences (using locations identified above)

Step 3:
Adding in the ATHILA sequences 

Extra Step3b: 
Isolating ATHILA by Centromere Group

Step 4:
Combining all the sequences together

Step 5: 
Running TransDecoder

Step 6: 
Running pFam

Step 7:
Filtering out the integrases

Step 8:
Making sure only have unique integrase sequences

Step 9:
Get Huck Outgroup

Step 10:
Alyrata and Brassica get Integrases

Step 11:
Protein Alignment (MAFFT)

Step 12:
Tree creation (Fast Tree)

Step 13:
Colouring groups in the trees
